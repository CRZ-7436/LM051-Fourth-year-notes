### The Command Design Pattern (DP)

- **Objective**: To work through the Command Design Pattern and understand its refactoring.
- **Context**: The pattern is explored within the framework of a simple remote control where vendor classes and method signatures are unknown.

### Key Concepts of Command DP

- **Definition**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing clients to be parameterized with different requests, queues, or log requests, and supports undoable operations.
- **Motivation**: Addresses the need to issue requests to objects without knowing anything about the objects (receivers).

### Structure and Participants

- **Class Diagram**: Illustrates the structure of the Command DP.
- **Participants**:
    1. **Command**: Declares an interface for invoking an operation.
    2. **Concrete Command (e.g., LightOnCommand)**: Specifies a binding between a Receiver and an action.
    3. **Invoker (e.g., SimpleRemoteControl)**: Instructs the Command to carry out the request.
    4. **Client (e.g., SimpleRemoteControlTest)**: Creates ConcreteCommands and sets their receivers.
    5. **Receivers**: Perform the application-specific operation.

### Collaborations and Interaction

- **Collaborations**: A client creates a ConcreteCommand instance and sets its Receiver. The Invoker stores ConcreteCommands and issues requests by calling Execute().
- **Interaction**: The ConcreteCommand invokes its Receiver to perform an Action().

### Applicability of Command DP

- **Use Cases**:
    - Parameterizing objects with actions to perform.
    - Supporting undo operations and logging calls for crash recovery.
    - Basis for transactional systems.

### Consequences and Implementation Issues

- **Consequences**: Decouples the object that invokes the operation from the one that performs it. Commands can be stored, manipulated, and assembled into composites (Macro Command).
- **Implementation Issues**:
    - Determining the intelligence level of a command.
    - Avoiding error accumulation in the undo process.
    - May require the use of the Memento DP for state preservation.

### Exercise and Reading Suggestions

- **Exercise**: Discuss how the Command DP can be used to develop a UI toolkit/framework.
