### Overview of SOLID Principles

- **SOLID**: A set of design principles for object-oriented programming aimed at making software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
- **Based on**: Robert C. Martin's work in "Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices."

### The Five SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
    
    - A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
    - Example: `Employee` class with separate responsibilities like `CalcPay`, `ReportHours`, and `WriteEmployee`.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
    
    - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    - Emphasizes the use of abstraction to avoid modifying existing code when adding new functionality.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
    
    - Objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.
    - Example: Issues with substituting a `Square` object for a `Rectangle`.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:
    
    - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
    - Encourages the creation of specific interfaces for different clients rather than one general-purpose interface.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
    
    - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
    - Example: Using interfaces (`Reader` and `Writer`) for dependency management in a `Copy` class.

### Dependency Management and Design Concerns

- **Dependency Management**: A key aspect of object-oriented design, focusing on managing coupling and cohesion.
- **7 Deadly Sins of Design**: Rigidity, fragility, immobility, viscosity, needless complexity, and opacity.

### Application and Examples

- **SRP Example**: Separating payroll calculation from employee data management.
- **OCP Example**: Using abstract classes to create a flexible drawing application.
- **LSP Example**: The square-rectangle problem and its implications for class design.
- **ISP Example**: Avoiding interface pollution by creating distinct interfaces for different client needs.
- **DIP Example**: Implementing reader and writer interfaces to decouple components in a copy function.
