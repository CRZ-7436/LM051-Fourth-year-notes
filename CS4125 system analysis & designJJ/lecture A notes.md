### 6. Good Software Characteristics

- Usability, reliability, affordability, flexibility, and availability.
- Importance of modular decomposition (advocated by David Parnas).
- Focus on dependency, coupling, cohesion, interface, encapsulation, and abstraction.

### 7. Design and Interfaces

- Importance of interfaces in software design.
- Discussion on contract-based design and the role of interfaces in defining module relationships.

### 8. Object-Oriented Paradigm

- Discussion on classes, objects, generalization, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Examples of polymorphism in action and its benefits for software evolution.

### 9. Software Design Notations

- The role and limitations of UML in software design.
- Discussion on the shift towards agile practices and the relevance of UML in modern software engineering.

### 10. Exercises and Readings

- Suggested readings from Bennett, McRobb, and Farmer, and Stevens and Pooley.
