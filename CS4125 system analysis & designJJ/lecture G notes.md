### . Introduction to the Decorator Design Pattern

- **Definition**: Attaches additional responsibilities or functions to an object dynamically or statically.
- **Benefits**: Provides a flexible alternative to subclassing, allows adding new functions to an object without affecting others, and makes responsibilities easily added and removed.

### 2. Decorator Pattern Explained

- **Pizza Example**: Illustrates the problem of combinatorial explosion in subclassing and how the decorator pattern can address this by dynamically adding toppings to pizza objects.
- **Implementation**: The pattern allows for creating different combinations of toppings without modifying the Pizza class.

### 3. Decorator Pattern Structure

- **Basic Components**: Includes a `Pizza` interface with a `cost()` method, subclasses for different pizza sizes, and decorator classes for toppings.
- **Decorator Chain**: Demonstrates how decorators can be chained to add multiple functionalities.

### 4. Consequences of Using the Decorator Pattern

- Offers more flexibility than static inheritance.
- Avoids feature-laden classes high up in the inheritance hierarchy.
- Decorators act as a transparent enclosure around the component.
- Potential for object explosion.

### 5. Practical Application and Examples

- **Sales Order System**: Uses the decorator pattern for printing multiple headers/footers on a sales ticket.
- **Java I/O**: Demonstrates the use of the decorator pattern in Java's Input/Output streams.

### 6. Sample Code Implementation

- **Subject and Concrete Subject**: Sample code for implementing the subject interface and concrete subject in the decorator pattern.
- **Observer and Concrete Observer**: Sample code for implementing the observer interface and a concrete observer example.

### 7. Design Context and More Design Patterns

- Recap of system and detailed design, highlighting the distinction between architecture and detailed design.
- Introduction to other design patterns like Singleton, Composite, State, and Strategy.

### 8. Design Principles Embodied in Patterns

- Principles such as programming to interfaces, favoring delegation over inheritance, the Open Closed Principle, and encapsulating variability.
