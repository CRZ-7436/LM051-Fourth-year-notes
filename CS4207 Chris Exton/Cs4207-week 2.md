1. **Concurrency and Parallelism in Software Development**:
    
    - The topic is introduced as a significant aspect of modern software development.
2. **Textbooks and Resources**:
    
    - Several textbooks are referenced for the course, including "The Go Programming Language" by Alan A. A. Donovan and "Concurrency in Go" by Katherine Coxbuday, among others.
3. **Motivation for Concurrency and Parallelism**:
    
    - The rise of multicore CPUs and GPUs has made concurrency and parallelism more relevant to a broader audience.
    - Traditional languages and methods for concurrent programming are often awkward, error-prone, and difficult for compilers to parallelize automatically.
4. **History of Concurrency**:
    
    - Concurrency in hardware dates back to the 1950s with special-purpose processors.
    - The concept of a thread in software appeared around 1965 with the Berkeley Timesharing System.
    - Early programming languages like IBMâ€™s PL/I included constructs for forking threads.
    - Unix introduced the process as a sequential thread of control with a virtual address space, and eventually, the concept of threads as we know them today was developed.
5. **Evolution of Concurrent Programming**:
    
    - Initially, concurrency was mainly confined to operating system design and high-performance computing.
    - Ada was one of the few mainstream languages to include concurrency in its specification until Java brought threads into the mainstream for application programmers.
6. **Traditional and Modern Areas for Concurrency**:
    
    - Traditionally, concurrency was addressed in operating systems, scientific computing, and server-side applications.
    - Modern applications of concurrency include desktop applications, games, development tools, and mobile phones, which are now often multicore.
7. **Operating Systems**:
    
    - Operating systems manage concurrently operating hardware devices, multitasking, and resource sharing among programs.
    - Mobile devices, with their variety of tasks and increasing performance demands, are highlighted as an area of growth for concurrency.
8. **Super Computer Example (Blue Gene)**:
    
    - Blue Gene is presented as an example of a supercomputer with 1024 nodes, each with four cores and 2GB RAM, illustrating the scale at which concurrency operates in high-performance computing.
9. **Distributed Systems**:
    
    - The slides touch upon distributed systems as network-based systems that provide services to multiple clients simultaneously.
