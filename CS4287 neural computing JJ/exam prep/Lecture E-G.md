#### Lecture E: MLP in Python

- **MNIST Dataset**: The lecture covers training a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 images, split into 50,000 for training and 10,000 for validation.
- **Nielsenâ€™s MLP Code for MNIST**: The code involves a 3-layered traditional MLP. It uses the NumPy package for array (tensor) manipulation and vectorized functions like sigmoid.
- **Network Structure**: The MLP consists of an input layer with 784 inputs (28x28 pixels), a hidden layer with 30 sigmoid neurons, and an output layer with 10 neurons.
- **Training Process**: The training involves stochastic gradient descent (SGD), partitioning data into mini-batches, and updating weights and biases using backpropagation.
- **Fine-Tuning Parameters**: The lecture suggests running tests and fine-tuning parameters for optimal performance.

#### Lecture F: Intro to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

- **Convolution in Machine Vision**: Introduction to applying filter kernels to images for feature detection, using examples like the Sobel edge detector.
- **CNN Basics**: CNNs learn kernels/filters to extract primitive features for higher-order abstractions. The lecture discusses the structure of CNNs, including convolutional layers and filters.
- **Stride and Padding**: Explains concepts like stride (step size of the filter) and padding (adding zeros around the input volume).
- **Pooling Layer**: Discusses the pooling layer in CNNs, used for downsampling.
- **Famous CNN Architectures**: Covers LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet, and ResNet, highlighting their unique features and contributions to the field.

#### Lecture G: Python in 30 mins

- **Python Basics**: Provides a brief introduction to Python, covering its history, philosophy, and basic syntax.
- **Python Interpreter and Installation**: Discusses using the Python interpreter, installing Python, and IDE options like IDLE.
- **Python Syntax and Data Types**: Covers basic Python syntax, data types (integers, floats, strings), and sequence types (tuples, lists, strings).
- **Python Operations**: Explains operations on lists and tuples, including indexing, slicing, and methods like append, extend, and sort.
- **Python Functions**: Introduces built-in functions and the use of the `zip` function for combining sequences.
