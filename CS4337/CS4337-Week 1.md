**Course Rationale/Purpose:**

- To acquaint students with the challenges and practices in managing and governing big data.
- Coverage includes the Hadoop ecosystem, distributed file systems, big data programming models, scalable database system solutions, data warehousing, and big data security and protection.

**Syllabus Overview:**

1. **Big Data Fundamentals**:
    - Definition of big data and its characteristics: volume, velocity, variety (the three Vs).
    - Data governance aspects: accuracy, availability, usability, and security.
    - The impact of big data on industries and society.
2. **Programming Frameworks & Systems**:
    
    - Distributed file systems and scalable computing.
    - MapReduce and Spark programming models.
    - Overview of the Hadoop ecosystem's main components.
3. **Database Systems**:
    
    - Scalable relational database systems: partitioning and sharding.
    - NoSQL database systems: key-value, column-family, document-oriented, and graph databases.
4. **Data Warehousing**:
    
    - The role and architecture of a data warehouse.
    - ETL processes: extraction, transformation, load.
    - Comparison between operational systems and data warehouses.
5. **Big Data Security & Protection**:
    
    - Challenges and practices in big data security.
    - Privacy-preserving data composition, encryption, granular access control, user authentication models, endpoint filtering, and validation.

**Learning Outcomes:**

- Understand the technological challenges in big data governance.
- Describe the Hadoop ecosystem and the MapReduce programming model.
- Differentiate between relational and NoSQL database systems in terms of scalability.
- Explain the components of a data warehouse.
- Discuss the challenges and practices in big data security.
- Reflect on the societal and industrial impacts of big data.

**Big Data Detailed Concepts:**

- **Gartner's Definition**: High-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety information assets that require cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing.
- **3 Vs of Big Data**:
    - **Volume**: Massive increase in data (from 0.8 zettabytes to 35zb).
    - **Velocity**: Rapid generation and processing of data.
    - **Variety**: Different types of data (relational, text, semi-structured, graph).
- **Scaling Database Systems**: The need for more scalable solutions due to the explosion of data dimensions.

**Scaling Strategies:**

- **Scale Out**: Adding more nodes to a system (horizontal scaling).
- **Scale Up**: Adding more resources to an existing system (vertical scaling).
