The slides for Lecture 2 of your Big Data Management & Security course cover the following key points about Big Data:

- **Scalability of Database Systems**: The slides discuss the concepts of scaling out (using more resources to distribute workload in parallel) and scaling up (efficiently using the resource with architecture-aware algorithm design).
- **Big Data Techniques**: They cover various techniques such as massive parallelism, huge data volumes storage, data distribution, high-speed networks, high-performance computing task and thread management, data mining and analytics, machine learning, and data visualization.
- **Typical Scenario vs. Big Data**: The slides compare typical scenarios with big data in terms of application development, platform, data management, and resources.
- **Big Data's Importance**: It emphasizes why big data is a big deal now, highlighting the increase in data collection, open-source code, commodity hardware/cloud, and artificial intelligence.
- **Big Data and AI/ML**: This section is dedicated to the relationship between big data and AI/ML.
- **Big Data Statistics**: Some significant statistics related to big data are shared, such as the amount of data generated by individuals and businesses, and the impact of big data on companies like Netflix.
- **Importance of Data**: The slides quote Clive Humby on data being the new oil and suggest resources to understand how data influences us.
- **Impact of Big Data Analytics**: This section is marked as "TBA" indicating that it was to be addressed.
- **Google Case Study**: An example is provided of how Google uses MapReduce to process large amounts of data.
- **MapReduce**: The concept of MapReduce is explained, including its benefits such as automatic parallelization, distribution, I/O scheduling, load balancing, fault tolerance, and scalability.
- **Classic Word Count Example**: An example of a classic problem solved by MapReduce is given.
- **Summary**: A summary of MapReduce as a programming paradigm for data-intensive computing is provided.
