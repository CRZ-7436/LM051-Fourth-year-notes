Partition tolerance
Data to be partitioned across network segments due to network failures


BASE, an ACID alternative
	almost the opposite of ACID
	- basically available: Nodes in the distributed environment can go down, but the whole system shouldnt be affected
	- Soft State(Scalable): the state of the system and data changes over time (copies of a data item may be inconsistent).
	- Eventual consistency: given enough time, data will be consistent across the distributed system.

Eventual consistency
	when no updates occur for a long period of time:
	- eventually all updates will propagate through the system and all the nodes will be consistent
	for a given accepted update and a given node:
	- eventually either the update reaches the node, or the node is removed from the service


Comparison
Acid
	- strong consistency
	- less availability
	- pessimistic concurrency
	- complex

BASE
	- availability is the most important thing. Willing to sacrifice for this (CAP)
	- Weaker consistency(eventual)
	- Best effort
	- simple and fast
	- optimistic


Problems with RDBMS
	impedance mismatch
		object relational mapping doesnt work well
	rigid schema design
	harder to scale
	replication
	joins across multiple nodes?(very difficult to do)
	How does RDBMS handle data growth? Hard
	Need for a DB
	many programmers are already familiar with it
	Transactions and ACID make development easy
	lots of tools to use

What does NoSQL not provide
	no built in joins
	no ACID transactions
	no SQL


Data Model
	BSON format (binary JSON)
	Developers can easily map to modern object 

JSON
	field value
	- scalar(int, boolean. string, data....)
	- Document (embedding or nesting)
	- Array of JSON objects
